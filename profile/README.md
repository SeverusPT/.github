# Welcome to the SeverusPT project

Using satellite and field data, the SeverusPT project aims to provide, in a periodic and timely manner, relevant information on the evaluation and prediction of fire severity. By including national entities engaged in fire management, planning and land management, Earth Observation and the general public, the project aims to monitor, protect and support ecosystem restoration.


# Project description üìó

Context: despite increasing investments in fire suppression, extreme fire events have become more frequent in Mediterranean Europe, including mainland Portugal. The SeverusPT project addresses this challenge by developing a comprehensive framework for assessing, mapping, and predicting fire severity using satellite-derived indicators of ecosystem functioning related to carbon, water, and energy balance.


## Main objectives üéØ

- Develop a spatially explicit framework to assess, map, and predict fire severity
    
- Deliver a co-designed product/service that enhances institutional and operational capacity for fire hazard management and post-fire restoration
    
- Foster collaboration with key stakeholders for long-term sustainability and continuous improvement of the product/service
    
- Contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in fire severity mapping and modelling and understanding its driving factors and links to fire hazard management


## Key features üõ∞Ô∏èüî•‚õ∞Ô∏è

- Robust framework: The project implements a spatially explicit framework that assesses, maps, and predicts fire severity, considering the effects of fires on ecosystems under a changing climate
    
- Satellite data analysis: Spectral and ecosystem functioning indicators extracted through remote sensing are leveraged to assess fire severity and provide detailed characterizations on a large scale
    
- Web-based services: A user-friendly web service is being developed to provide continuous and standardized fire severity products, facilitating preventive fire risk management, surveillance, and post-fire restoration efforts
